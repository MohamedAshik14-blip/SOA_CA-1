üå§Ô∏è Weather & Trip Planner ‚Äì SOA_CA-1

Project Overview

Weather & Trip Planner is a Blazor Web Application built in C# for the SD4 SOA module.
It allows users to:
	‚Ä¢	Search for countries and cities info
	‚Ä¢	View real-time weather and 3-day forecasts
	‚Ä¢	Explore top cities with population and distance filters
	‚Ä¢	Save favorites for quick access

This project demonstrates Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles using multiple RESTful web services, integrating them into a contextualized trip-planning domain.
